# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will dive into any security-related issue as long as your Excelize version is still supported by us. When reporting an issue, include as much information as possible, but no need to fill fancy forms or answer tedious questions. Just tell us what you found, how to reproduce it, and any concerns you have about it. We will respond as soon as possible and follow up with any missing information.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please e-mail us directly at `xuri.me@gmail.com` or use the security issue template on GitHub. In general, public disclosure is made after the issue has been fully identified and a patch is ready to be released. A security issue gets the highest priority assigned and a reply regarding the vulnerability is given within a typical 24 hours. Thank you!
