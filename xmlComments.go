// rich text note that is attached to and associated with a cell, separate from
// other cell content. Comment content is stored separate from the cell, and is
// displayed in a drawing object (like a text box) that is separate from, but
// associated with, a cell. Comments are used as reminders, such as noting how a
// complex formula works, or to provide feedback to other users. Comments can
// also be used to explain assumptions made in a formula or to call out
// something special about the cell.
